# PISA Data
## by Ken Norton

## Dataset

Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) is a survey of students' skills and knowledge as they approach the end of compulsory education. It is not a conventional school test. Rather than examining how well students have learned the school curriculum, it looks at how well prepared they are for life beyond school.

Around 510,000 students in 65 economies took part in the PISA 2012 assessment of reading, mathematics and science representing about 28 million 15-year-olds globally. Of those economies, 44 took part in an assessment of creative problem solving and 18 in an assessment of financial literacy. The survey was sponsored by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). Here's a [technical report (PDF)](PISA-2012-technical-report-final.pdf) about the survey and methodology.

**Important Note:** The full dataset (pisa2012.csv) is not included in this repo because it is more than 2.7GB.

Just place the unzipped file in the `data` subdirectory.
