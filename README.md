This repository contains projects for Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002). Begun May 2019.

## [Intro Project: Explore Weather Trends](1_Exploring_Weather_Trends/1_Exploring_Weather_Trends.ipynb)

This project will introduce you to the SQL and how to download data from a database. You’ll analyze local
and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global
temperature trends.

## [Project 1: Investigate a Dataset](2_Investigate_A_Dataset/2_Investigate_A_Dataset.ipynb) (in progress)

In this project, you’ll choose one of Udacity's curated datasets and investigate it using NumPy and pandas.
You’ll complete the entire data analysis process, starting by posing a question and finishing by sharing your
findings.

## Project 2: Analyze Experiment Results

In this project, you will be provided a dataset reflecting data collected from an experiment. You’ll use
statistical techniques to answer questions about the data and report your conclusions and
recommendations in a report.

## Project 3: Wrangle and Analyze Data 

Real-world data rarely comes clean. Using Python, you'll gather data from a variety of sources, assess its
quality and tidiness, then clean it. You'll document your wrangling efforts in a Jupyter Notebook, plus
showcase them through analyses and visualizations using Python and SQL.

## Project 4: Communicate Data Findings

In this project, you will use Python’s data visualization tools to systematically explore a selected dataset for
its properties and relationships between variables. Then, you will create a presentation that communicates
your findings to others.
